                                                              *changesPlugin*
1. Functionality

This plugin was written to help visualize which lines have been changes since
editing started for a file. The plugin was inspired by so called changed-bars,
available at other editors, such as Embarcadero C++ Builder (there it is
called Change Bars, see:
http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/33453#6PersonalDeveloperProductivity)
or Visual Studio where it is called indicator margin (see
http://blog.eveningcreek.com/?p=151).

ChangesPlugin.vim uses the |diff|-feature of vim and compares the actual
buffer with it's saved state. In order to highlight the indicator signs at the
first column, its using |signs|. For newly added lines, the first column will
be displayed with a leading '+' and highlighted using the DiffAdd highlighting
(see |hl-DiffAdd|), deleted lines will be indicated by a '-' with a
DiffDelete highlighting (see |hl-DiffDelete|) and modified lines will be
displayed using '*' and a DiffChange highlighting (see |hl-DiffChange|).

This means, that in order to use this plugin you need a vim, that was built
with |+signs|-support and |+diff|-support and you also need an executable diff
command. If neither of these conditions are met, changePlugin.vim will issue a
warning and abort.

							 *:EnableChanges*
By default the plugin is not enabled. To enable it enter >
    :EnableChanges
When you run this command, changesPlugin.vim diffs the current file agains
its saved file on disk and displays the changes in the first column.

							*:DisableChanges*
If you want to disable the plugin, enter >
    :DisableChanges

2. Configuring changesPlugin.vim

There are basically four different configuration options available.

2.1 Highlighte the whole line
By default, changesPlugin.vim will only indicate a change in the first column.
Setting g:changes_hl_lines to 1 will highlight the whole line. By default this
variable is unset (which is the same as setting it to 0).
If you'd like to have this, set this variable in your |.vimrc| >
    :let g:changes_hl_lines=1

2.2 Auto-refresh the changes
By default changesPlugin.vim will not automatically update the view. You can
however configure it to do so. This will use an |CursorHold| autocommand to
update the indicator signs after |'updatetime'| seconds in Normal mode when
no key is pressed. To enable this feature, put this in your |.vimrc| >
    let g:changes_autocmd=1

2.3 Show what the indicator signs mean.
By default, whenever you run |:EnableChanges|, changesVim will print a short
status message, what each sign means. If you don't want this, put this in your
|.vimrc| >
    :let g:changes_verbose=0

2.4 Specify different colors.
changesVim uses the highlighting used for |diff| mode to indicate the change
in a buffer. This is consistent, since when you're already used to |vimdiff|
you'll probably also know the highlighting. If for any reason you do not like
the colors, you have to define your own highlighting items.
If for example you want the DiffAdd highlighting to be displayed like White on
a Blue background, you can define it as follows in your |.vimrc| >

    :hi DiffAdd term=bold ctermbg=4 guibg=DarkBlue

In the same way, you can change DiffDelete for indicating deleted lines and
DiffChange for indicating modified lines. You can also specify your favorite
highlighting colors using your own build |colorscheme|.
